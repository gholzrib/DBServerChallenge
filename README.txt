Other notes

	- The app is working from Android 4.1.X (API 16) until Android 7.1.1 (API 25), in order to take into account the User Story 5.
	This range was selected because of the Android Dashboard (https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html), where it's possible
	to see that most devices use an Android version between 4.1 and 7.1
